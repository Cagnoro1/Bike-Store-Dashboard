### Project Overview 
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a Bike store company over the years 2016 to 2018. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify the different trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance to help management make informed decisions.

### Data Sources 
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Bikestore.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
- Microsoft SQL Server (SQL) - Data Analysis 
- Azure Data Studio - used to host MSSQL
- Microsoft Excel - Data cleaning, Data Analysis 
- Tableau - Create Dashboard Report

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks: 

1.	Connect to the companyâ€™s regional database by writing an SQL script to generate a detailed data set that will provide all the data and information needed.
2.	Load and inspect data.
3.	Handled missing values.
4.	Data cleaning and formatting.
5.	Import the SQL-generated dataset into Excel and then use pivot tables to generate a dynamic dashboard.
6.	Connect the Excel datasheet  that contains the SQL-generated dataset to Tableau and use the information to generate a visually pleasing and dynamic dashboard for management.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Explored the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Who are the top customers?
- What was the yearly and monthly revenue from 2016-2018?
- What was the  revenue per state?
- What was each store's revenue?
- What was the revenue per category?
- What was the revenue per sales rep?
